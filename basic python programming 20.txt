Question1
Create a function that takes a list of strings and integers, and filters out the list so that it
returns a list of integers only.

def filter_list(listt):
    listt_1 = []
    for element in listt:
        if type(element) == int :
            listt_1.append(element)
    return listt_1


Question2
Given a list of numbers, create a function which returns the list but with each element&#39;s
index in the list added to itself. This means you add 0 to the number at index 0, add 1 to the
number at index 1, etc...


def add_index(llist):
    index_llist = []
    for element in range(len(llist)):
        index_llist.append(llist[element]+element)
    return index_llist

Question3
Create a function that takes the height and radius of a cone as arguments and returns the
volume of the cone rounded to the nearest hundredth. See the resources tab for the formula.

def cone_volume(height, radius):
    volume = ((22/7)*((radius)*(radius))*(height))/3
    return round(volume,2)
	

Question4
This Triangular Number Sequence is generated from a pattern of dots that form a triangle.
The first 5 numbers of the sequence, or dots, are:
1, 3, 6, 10, 15
This means that the first triangle has just one dot, the second one has three dots, the third one
has 6 dots and so on.
Write a function that gives the number of dots with its corresponding triangle number of the
sequence.

def triangle(number):
    return int(((number) * (number + 1)) / 2)

Question5
Create a function that takes a list of numbers between 1 and 10 (excluding one number) and
returns the missing number.

def missing_number(lisst):
    full_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
    missing_number_list = []
    for element in full_list:
        if element not in lisst:
            missing_number_list.append(element)
    return missing_number_list
