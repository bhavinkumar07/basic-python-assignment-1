Question 1:
Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.
D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated
sequence.
Example
Let us assume the following comma separated input sequence is given to the program:
100,150,180
The output of the program should be:
18,22,24

string_ = '100,150,180'
temp = ""
number_list = string_.split(",") 

C = 50
H = 30

result = []
for i in number_list:
    Q = ((2 * C * int(i)) / H ) ** (1/2)
    result.append(int(Q))

result_str = "{},{},{}".format(*result)
print(result_str)



Question 2:
Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The
element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.
Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,Â¡Y-1.
Example
Suppose the following inputs are given to the program:
3,5
Then, the output of the program should be:
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]

row = int(input("Please Enter Number of rows"))
column = int(input("Please Enter Number of column"))

max_list = []

for i in range(row):
    mini_list = []
    for j in  range(column):
        mini_list.append(i*j)
    max_list.append(mini_list)

print(max_list)


Question 3:
Write a program that accepts a comma separated sequence of words as input and prints the
words in a comma-separated sequence after sorting them alphabetically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
without,hello,bag,world
Then, the output should be:
bag,hello,without,world

def hello():
    input_string = input()
    list_string = input_string.split(",")
    list_string.sort()
    str_ = ",".join(list_string)
    
    print(str_)


Question 4:
Write a program that accepts a sequence of whitespace separated words as input and prints
the words after removing all duplicate words and sorting them alphanumerically.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world and practice makes perfect and hello world again
Then, the output should be:
again and hello makes perfect practice world


string_input = input()
split_list = string_input.split()

set_ = set(split_list)

list_ = list(set_)

list_.sort()

print(" ".join(list_))





Question 5:
Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of letters and digits.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world! 123
Then, the output should be:
LETTERS 10

DIGITS 3


sentence = input()
count_letter = 0
count_number = 0

capital_alphabets = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
small_alphabets = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
numbers = "1234567890"

for element in sentence:
    if element in capital_alphabets or element in small_alphabets:
        count_letter += 1
    if element in numbers:
        count_number += 1

print("Letter is ",count_letter)        
print("Number is ",count_number)





Question 6:
A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to
check the validity of password input by users.
Following are the criteria for checking the password:
1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them
according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each
separated by a comma.
Example
If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
Then, the output of the program should be:
ABd1234@1





def password(list_password):
    
    sentence_list = list_password.split(",")

    capital_alphabets = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    small_alphabets = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    numbers = "1234567890"
    special_character = """?><":}{+_)(*&^%$#@!~.+-*//.,';][=-`"""

    for sentence in sentence_list:

        if len(sentence) >= 6 and len(sentence) <= 12:
            flag_ = True
            for element in sentence:
                if (element in capital_alphabets) and (element in small_alphabets) and (element in numbers) and (element in special_character):
                    flag_ = True
        else:
            flag_
            
        while True:
            return sentence

        
list_password = input()
password(list_password)
