1. What exactly is []?
[] is asymbol of a list. For example if we want to make list by name date then date = [], we can define list which is empty at the declare time.
We can add values in the list also.


2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value "hello" as the
third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
spam.insert(2,"hello")


Let"s pretend the spam includes the list ["a", "b", "c", "d"] for the next three queries.


3. What is the value of spam[int(int"3" * 2) / 11)]?
It will show syntax error. 


4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
	'd'

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
['a','b']

Let"s pretend bacon has the list [3.14, "cat" ,11, "cat" , True] for the next three questions.

6. What is the value of bacon.index"cat")?
	1

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
   [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]


8. How does bacon.remove"cat") change the look of the list in bacon?
[3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
list concatenation operator is "+"
replication operator is "*"


10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
append() method will add the element at the last position whereas insert() method will insert element at any postion where we want to wish. 
For Example - becon.insert(1,555). In this example 555 will add at the 1st index .


11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
remove() and pop()


12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
list is a mutable data structure. It is defined in square bracket []
string is immutable structure. It is defined in double or single quots


13. What"s the difference between tuples and lists?
tuples are defined in simple bracket like (). It is immutable data structure.
list are defined in square bracket like []. It is mutable data structure


14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
	spam=(42)

15. How do you get a list value"s tuple form? How do you get a tuple value"s list form?
List to tuple 
listttt= [1,2,3,4,"bhavin"]
tuple(listttt)

tuple to list
tupple = (1,2,3,4,"hello")
list(tupple)


16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they
contain?
They contain references to list values

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
copy.copy() function will do a shallow copy means if any changes done to the copied object then it will reflect to to original object.
copy.deepcopy() function will do a deep copy which means if any changes done to the copied object then it will not reflect to the original object.
