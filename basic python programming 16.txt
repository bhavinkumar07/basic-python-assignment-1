Question1. Write a function that stutters a word as if someone is struggling to read it. The
first two letters are repeated twice with an ellipsis ... and space after each, and then the
word is pronounced with a question mark ?.

def stutter(string):
    stutter_string = string[0] + string[1] + "... " + string[0] + string[1] + "... "
    for char in string:
        stutter_string = stutter_string + char
    return stutter_string + "?"


Question 2.Create a function that takes an angle in radians and returns the corresponding
angle in degrees rounded to one decimal place.

def radians_to_degree(radians):
    return round((radians * 180) / (22/7),1)


Question 3. In this challenge, establish if a given integer num is a Curzon number. If 1 plus
2 elevated to num is exactly divisible by 1 plus 2 multiplied by num, then num is a Curzon
number.
Given a non-negative integer num, implement a function that returns True if num is a Curzon
number, or False otherwise.

def is_curson(number):
    number_1 = (2 ** number) + 1 
    number_2 = (2 * number) + 1
    if (number_1 % number_2) == 0 :
        return True
    else:
        return False


Question 4.Given the side length x find the area of a hexagon.

def area_of_hexagon(side):
    return round((3*(3**(1/2))*(side**2))/2,1)

Question 5. Create a function that returns a base-2 (binary) representation of a base-10
(decimal) string number. To convert is simple: ((2) means base-2 and (10) means base-10)

def binary(number):
    binary_ = ""
    while number != 0 :
        if number % 2 == 0:
            binary_ = "0" + binary_
        else:
            binary_ = "1" + binary_
        number = number // 2
    return binary_
