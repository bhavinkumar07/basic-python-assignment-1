PYTHON BASIC ASSIGNMENT 1 

1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
* is mathematical operator for multiplication
'hello' is value as string
-87.8 is a value as float
- is a mathematical operator for subtractor
/ is a mathematical operator for division
+ is a mathematical operator for addition
6 is a value as a integer

2. What is the difference between string and variable?
String is collection of characters,numbers,sentence, special characters etc. In python it is define in double or single quots.

Whereas variables are as its name,it can be declared by the programmer for its use to assign datatypes like ,
a=12 'a' is a variable and its value is 12 integer.
b="bhavin saxena"   'b' is a variable and "bhavin saxena" is a sring

Variable name should not be some reserved key word like pass,continue,break etc.

String must be declared in double quots or single quots but variable can be declared any char or word except integer,float etc.

3. Describe three different data types.	
boolean: In this type it has only two values either True or False. In programming if there are some conditions where there are only two options True or False

string: String is a type where it comes in sinngle or double quots. We can add anything like characters,sentence, word,specialcharacter, numbers etc.example a="hello ineuron"

list: List is a datatype where it is defines in square brackets [ ]. We can add any datatype in list like string,integer,list in list,imaginary numbers,boolean etc.
Ex= l=[1,2,"hello",True,1+5j,[2,"bhavin"]]

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
expression is made up of operators,value,variables.
all expressions comes to some value as a result.
Ex-  x=5
	 x=x+1   these two lines are combination of expressions and it comes to its result x=6.So x,=,+,1 are expressions.

5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?
expressions are spam,=,10,like.
statement is a group of expressions for some task to be finished . 


6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon=22
bacon+1 After running this code bacon value is will remain same as 22 but the output will be 23.
If bacon=bacon+1 is the code then the value of bacon will be 23 as well as output will 23.

7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
The output will be same as 'spamspamspam' because in 'spam'+'spamspam' both are same datatypes as string so '+' operator will concatinate
And * operator in sring will alse repeate the string the number which is multipy.

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
100 is invalid variable because it is a number datatype and number is not used for variables.
If we use  egg100 veriable then it is a valid variable name as 100 is used after egg.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
for integer=int()
for floating-point = float()
for string=string()

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
I have eaten "99+" burries"
If we want to add 99 in between two strings the we can convert 99 into srting by str() function "I have eaten "+str(99)+" burries"
or 
"I have eaten "+"99"+"burries" by adding 99 in single or double quots
