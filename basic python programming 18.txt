Question 1
Create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and return a new list
without the strings.

def filter_test(l):
    new_list = []
    for i in l:
        if type(i) == int:
            new_list.append(i)
    return new_list


Question 2
The &quot;Reverser&quot; takes a string as input and returns that string in reverse order, with the
opposite case.


def reverse(s):
    new_s = s[::-1]
    return new_s.swapcase()
    

Question 3
You can assign variables from lists like this:
lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
first = lst[0]
middle = lst[1:-1]
last = lst[-1]
print(first) ➞ outputs 1
print(middle) ➞ outputs [2, 3, 4, 5]
print(last) ➞ outputs 6
With Python 3, you can assign variables from lists in a much more succinct way. Create
variables first, middle and last from the given list using destructuring assignment
(check the Resources tab for some examples), where:
first ➞ 1
middle ➞ [2, 3, 4, 5]
last ➞ 6

Your task is to unpack the list writeyourcodehere into three variables, being first,
middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then
print all three variables.


writeyourcodehere = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

first ,middle ,last = writeyourcodehere[0], writeyourcodehere[1 :-1], writeyourcodehere[-1]

print(f"First element is {first} , second element is {middle} and last element is  {last}")




Question 4
Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number recursively.
Examples

def facto(a):
    if a == 1:
        return 1
    elif a == 0:
        print("You entered zero")
    elif a < 1:
        print("Please enter positive number")
    else:
        factorial = a * facto(a-1)
        return factorial


Question 5
Write a function that moves all elements of one type to the end of the list.

def move_to_(lll,x):
    for i in lll:
        if i == x :
            lll.append(lll.pop(lll.index(i)))
    return lll
