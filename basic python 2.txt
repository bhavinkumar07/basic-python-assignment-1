1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
There are two boolean data types, True and False.True is 1 and False is 0.
As python is a case sensative language so fisrt letters are capital True False
They are mostly used as conditional operations.

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
They are "and" ,"or" and "not" boolean operators.

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

True  and True  is True
True  and False is False
False and True  is False
False and False is False 

True  or True   is True
True  or False  is True
False or True   is True
False or False  is False

not True  is False
not False is True

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) False
not (5 > 4) False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) False
(True and True) and (True == False) False
(not False) or (not True) True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
> , < , == , <= , >= ,!=

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.
When we would like to assign some values to variables the single equals sign "=" is used or we can say operator is used.
And when we have and condition of comparison of two variables or sometheing we usedouble  equal operator "=="
Ex-
x=10  # Assignment operator
if x==10: # equal operator
	print("hello")
Above example clearly says that "=" in x=10 is assign operator.Where value of x is assign 10 by "=" operator.
And if 	the condition x is euqal to 10 is true then print statement will execute.

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10: #First Block
	print("eggs")
if spam > 5:   #Second Block
	print('bacon')
else:         #Third Block
	print('ham')
	print('spam')
	print('spam') 
	
8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
spam=25
if spam==1:
    print('Hello')
elif spam==2:
    print("Houwdy")
else:
    print("""Greetings""")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
CTRL+C is key use.


10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
break is use to stop from the current loop whereas continue is use to stop from the current execution.
Ex-
for char in "bhavin":
    if char == "a":
        continue
    print(char)
	#o/  a will skip
	b
	h
	v
	i
	n	
in the above example if the condition will true then it will stop the current execution and will execute next iteration of the same loop

for char in "bhavin":
    if char == "a":
        break
    print(char)
in the above if the condition will true then the whole loop will stop.
o/p
b
h 
 	

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
All are same as in range(10) it is by default take range(0,10,1)
in range(0,10) it will take by defalul range(0,10,1)
range(0,10,1) range(starting position 0 , (10-1)th position ,jump)
0is the starting postion



12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
# For loop
for i in range(10):
    print(i+1)
# While loop	
i=1
while i<11:
    print(i)
    i=i+1
	
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?
spam.bacon()
