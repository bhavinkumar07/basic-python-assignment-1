Question1. Create a function that takes three arguments a, b, c and returns the sum of the
numbers that are evenly divided by c from the range a, b inclusive.

def evenly_divisible(a, b, c):
    result_list = []
    for i in range(a,b+1):
        if i % c == 0:
            result_list.append(i)
    return sum(result_list)    

Question2. Create a function that returns True if a given inequality expression is correct and
False otherwise.

def correct_signs(sign):
    result_sing=eval(sign)
    if result_sing:
        return True
    else:
        return False 
Question3. Create a function that replaces all the vowels in a string with a specified character.


def replace_vovels(string , special_char):
    vovels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    replaced_vovel = ""
    for char in string:
        if char in vovels:
            char = special_char
        replaced_vovel = replaced_vovel + char
    
    return replaced_vovel

Question4. Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number recursively.


def factorial(number):
    if number == 0:
        return 1
    elif number == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        while number != 1 :
            return (number * factorial(number-1))
        number = number - 1
    

Question 5
Hamming distance is the number of characters that differ between two strings.
To illustrate:

def hamming_distance(string_1, string_2):
    count = 0
    for char_1, char_2 in zip (string_1, string_2):
        if char_1 != char_2:
            count = count + 1
    return count
